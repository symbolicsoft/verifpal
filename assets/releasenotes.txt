Verifpal 0.28.1 features an important correctness fix, several bug fixes, and performance improvements.

Correctness Fix: AEAD Associated Data Modeling
----------------------------------------------

Verifpal now correctly models AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) semantics. Previously, in some instances, Verifpal did not reveal the associated data to the Dolev-Yao attacker when observing AEAD ciphertexts. This has been fixed with a new PassiveReveal mechanism that ensures attackers can always observe the associated data portion of AEAD constructions, matching real-world behavior.

Thanks to Stefano Berlato for reporting this issue.

Fix Non-Termination in Active Attacker Verification
----------------------------------------------

The exhaustion check in verifyActiveStages compared knowledge count using
a local copy that didn't reflect concurrent modifications from reconstruction.
This caused models with multi-argument primitives (like HKDF) to run forever
as reconstruction kept generating derived values even when mutations weren't
making progress toward resolving queries.

Changes:
- Add attackerStateGetKnownCount() for thread-safe access to knowledge count
- Track worthwhile mutations per stage using atomic counter
- Improve exhaustion condition: exhaust if stage > 5 AND any of:
  - No worthwhile mutations found in stage
  - No knowledge growth (using thread-safe count)
  - Stage exceeds maxStageLimit (64) as fallback for combinatorial explosion

This fixes analysis of models like fakeauth.vp which previously would not
terminate due to HKDF reconstruction generating endless permutations.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Race condition fix: Corrected an unsafe double-checked locking pattern in attacker state management that could cause stale data reads
- Side effect fix: minIntInSlice no longer modifies its input slice unexpectedly
- Deep copy fix: Password constants now correctly preserve their qualifier type during value copy operations
- Nil pointer guard: Added protection against potential panic on malformed equations

Performance Improvements
------------------------

- O(1) primitive lookups using map-based indexing instead of linear search
- Efficient string concatenation using strings.Builder
- Pre-allocated slices to reduce memory allocations
- Range-based loop conversions throughout the codebase
- Net reduction of 31 lines while improving performance

Code Quality
------------

- Updated linter configuration and addressed additional code quality warnings
